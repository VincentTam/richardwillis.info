This posts describes how to:

- Setup CloudFront & S3 in AWS
- Setup an Alternate domain with TLS

## Setup CloudFront & S3

It can be a little complex to get CloudFront and S3 configured correctly. The correct CORS configuration is required as you'll be serving your assets on a different domain to your main site, and the assets need to be "given permission" to work on specified origin domains.

My initial attempt at this resulted in my assets being too aggressively cached, and they would not load via `fetch` as the CORS headers (or lack thereof) were cached by CloudFront. It's thus important to configure the caching policy correctly.

After a lot trial and error I managed to create a working cloudformation template.

The following template creates the following resources:

- An S3 bucket with CORS configured for a list of allowed origins.
- A CloudFront OriginAccessIdentity that allows CloudFront to read from S3.
- A CloudFront caching policy with the correct CORS configuration.
- A CloudFront distribution that uses the S3 bucket as origin source.

```

Note the following:

- The SSL certificate and Alternate domain name are not automatically set (see below).
- The bucket is created in the region you used when creating the cloudformation stack.

## Allowing access to S3 bucket from CloudFront

By default the S3 bucket will not be public, and we want to keep it that way, but we need to explicitly allow CloudFront to access the files.

An "Origin Access Identity" resource is created as part of the above stack, but you need to manually edit the distribution to assign the identity. You can do this by editing the Origin for the distribution in the AWS UI.

1. Edit the CloudFront distribution
2. Select "Restrict Bucket Access"
3. Select "Use an Existing Identity"
4. Select the "Access S3 bucket content only through CloudFront" identity
5. For "Grant Read Permissions on Bucket", I set "No, I Will Update Permissions" (but I didn't need to adjust the permissions).

## Setting the root domain and certificate

1. Edit the CloudFront distribution and add your root domain to the Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs) field.
2. Select "Custom SSL Certificate (example.com):".
3. Click on "Request or Import a Certificate with ACM"
4. Check your AWS console region is `us-east-1` . This is important as CloudFront can only use certificates from `us-east-1`.
5. Follow the wizard to create a new certificate and edit your domain DNS to point a CNAME entry to your CloudFront domain
6. Wait for the verification to complete
7. Copy the certficate ARN.
8. Return to editing the CloudFront distribution and paste the certificate ARN.
9. Click save

Now you should be able to send a request to your CDN url:

```bash
curl -I https://assets.example.com/image.jpg
```

You might be `HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect` when attempting to GET the CloudFront URL. This is due to domain propagation when the bucket is created in any region that isn't `us-east-1`. To resolve the redirects, manually edit the CloudFront distribution origin to include the S3 bucket region, for example: `assets.example.com.s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com`

## Setting cache headers

CDN assets should be immutable and have long-cache headers (at least a year). Cache headers are set at an object level in S3, meaning you need to set headers when uploading assets to S3.

Typically you'd use the `aws s3 sync` command to upload assets, and this command accepts a `cache-control` header value. Here's an example of how it can work in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Sync static assets to S3
  uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@master
  with:
    args: --cache-control public,max-age=31536000,immutable
  env:
    AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    AWS_REGION: 'eu-west-2'
    SOURCE_DIR: '.next/static'
    DEST_DIR: '_next/static'
```

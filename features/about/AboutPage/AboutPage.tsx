          . I'm a front-end leaning full-stack developer with more than 10 years
          of professional web development experience. I enjoy coding as a day
          job and as a hobby (check out my{' '}
          <Link href="/projects">open-source projects</Link>). When not coding I
          enjoy being outdoors and love hiking and cycling. Sometimes I do a bit
          of indoor bouldering too.

          I grew up in South Africa before moving to London for a few years, and
          then to Barcelona for a few years. Recently I moved back to the UK, to
          beautiful rural North Yorkshire, which is where I'm currently based.

          I don't consider myself a very good photographer but I do really enjoy
          nature and being outdoors. Most of the photos below were taken on a
          mobile device.

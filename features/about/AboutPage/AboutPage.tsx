          . I'm an experienced software engineer specializing in Web
          Development. I enjoy coding as a day job and as a hobby. Check out my{' '}
          <Link href="/projects">open-source projects</Link>. When not coding I
          enjoy being outdoors hiking or cycling. Sometimes I do a bit of indoor
          bouldering too.

          I grew up in South Africa before moving to London for about 9 years.
          London is a great place for work but I did not enjoy the quality of
          life, and moved to Barcelona for about 4 years. Recently I moved back
          to the UK, to beautiful rural North Yorkshire, which is where I'm
          currently based.

        <p>
          I don't consider myself a very good photographer but I do really enjoy
          nature and being outdoors. Most of the photos below were taken on a
          mobile device.
